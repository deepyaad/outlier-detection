# outlier-detection

In this research paper I conduct a literature review of 40+ univariate outlier detection methods, propose 3 novel approaches of my own and develop an open source Python library with graphical tools.

This research was started over the course of my tenure as a Machine Learning Researcher at Genentech where I was positioned as the publicationâ€™s first author, pending funding.
